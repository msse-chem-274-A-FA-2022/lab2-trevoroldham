The atom types must denote an atom for each unique atom, which considers how the atom is bonded to other atoms. In ethane there is one unique carbon, and one unique hydrogen, as the carbons are equivalent and the hydrogens are all equivalent as well. The residue is a model of the molecules in the simulation which is one, and it contains the connectivity of the atoms which form the ethane molecule.
